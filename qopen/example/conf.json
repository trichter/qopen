#          the energy hits this level relative to the noise level) or
# - 'time>3SNR' (same as previous, but time after which the noise level
#                is checked is explicitly given, e.g. "S+10s>3SNR")
# The start time and end time can also be a list, in this case the largest

# Cut coda if a local minimum is present in data (e.g. because of a second
# earthquake with bulk waves arriving in the coda). Local maxima in the coda
# are compared to previous local minima. If the ratio between a maximum and
# the lowest minimum before the maximum is above a threshold the coda window
# will end at time of the minimum.
# Coda can optionally be smoothed before this operation.
# Example:
# "cut_coda": {"smooth": 5, "ratio": 5},
"cut_coda": null,

# Skip station if one of these conditions is fulfilled.
# Possible conditions:
# - "coda_window" shorter than x seconds

# "skip": {"coda_window": 5,
#          "distance": 500,

# The model is defined in qopen.source.source_model()
# The options passed to qopen.source.fit_sds() (see documentation there) are
# defined in the seismic_moment_options dictionary. It is for example possible
# to invert the source displacement spectrum for fc, n and gamma simultaniously
# or to fix a subset of the parameters and invert for the others.

# Optionally, a user defined alternative Green's function for scattering can be used.
